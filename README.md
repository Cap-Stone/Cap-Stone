The purpose of this project is to provide a management tool for our client.
Our client requires a tool that will keep track of her signs locations 
that her company may place in various locations around the Corpus Christi 
area. Our web application will make this process easier and also give them 
access to other functionalities such as statistics, client management, sign
management, as well as general information about them with a comforting and 
nice user interface.
